🚀 Power BI Project: PhonePe Transaction Analytics Dashboard PhonePe
I’m excited to share my latest Power BI project, where I analyzed and visualized PhonePe transaction data to uncover payment patterns, success trends, and customer behavior insights.

📊 Objective:
 To build a dynamic dashboard that tracks total transactions, payment success/failure rates, and service-wise performance for Loans, Insurance, Money Transfers, and Bill Payments.

💡 Key Insights:
 
 🔹 95%+ successful transactions across all services.
 
 🔹 Common failure causes: Wrong Info, Server Error, Bank Denial.
 
 🔹 July–August showed peak transaction activity.
 
 🔹 Loans & Insurance contributed the highest transaction volume.

🛠 Tools & Techniques:
 Power BI | DAX | Power Query | Data Modeling | Filters | Bookmarks | Page Navigation | Dashboard UI Design

📄 Dashboard Pages:
 Insurance | Loans | Money Transfer | Bills & Recharge | Overview
